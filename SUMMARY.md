## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (Getting Started)

### Step 1: Setup Development Environment (15 minutes)

```powershell
# Backend
cd d:\proj\new_psc_119
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your PostgreSQL credentials

# Create database
# Run: CREATE DATABASE psc119_db;

# Start backend
npm run dev

# In new terminal, seed database
node src/scripts/seed.js

# Frontend
cd frontend-public
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Test the System (10 minutes)

1. Open `http://localhost:3000`
2. Submit a test report
3. Track report by phone
4. Test login via API (use Postman/Thunder Client)
5. View SSE events in browser console

### Step 3: Customize for Your Needs

1. **Branding**: Update colors in `tailwind.config.js`
2. **Content**: Edit text in page components
3. **Categories**: Modify seed data in `src/scripts/seed.js`
4. **Validation**: Add custom rules in models/services

## 💡 Usage Examples

### For Developers

```javascript
// Add a new API endpoint
// 1. Create service method in /src/services
// 2. Create controller in /src/controllers
// 3. Add route in /src/routes
// 4. Test with Postman

// Example: Add SMS notification
// In reportService.js:
async createReport(reportData) {
  const report = await Report.create(reportData);
  await this.sendSMS(reportData.phone, 'Report received!');
  return report;
}
```

### For Admins

```bash
# Add new categories
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/admin/categories \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
